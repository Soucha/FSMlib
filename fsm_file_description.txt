by Michal Soucha 

Filename: <FSMtype>_<reduced><#states>[_hash]
 <FSMtype> ... type of given machine ... 'DFSM', 'Mealy', 'Moore', 'DFA',...
 <reduced> ... 'R' if the machine is reduced, 'U' otherwise
 <#states> ... the number of states of given machine
 hash      ... alphanumeric string of 5 symbols 
               to make the filename unique in given folder
               
- examples: Moore_R5.fsm, Moore_R5_TJB5Q.fsm, Mealy_U10.fsm

File's content:
t r
n p q
m
output and state-transition functions listing according to the machine type
- all values are separated by a space

t=1 DFSM
 =2 Mealy machine
 =3 Moore machine
 =4 DFA
r=0 unreduced
 =1 reduced
n ... the number of states
p ... the number of inputs
q ... the number of outputs
m ... maximal state ID

Output functions: (depends on the machine type)
 n lines: state <output of the state>(1 value)
 n lines: state <output on the transition for each input>(p values)
state-transition function:
 n lines: state <the next state for each input>(p values)
